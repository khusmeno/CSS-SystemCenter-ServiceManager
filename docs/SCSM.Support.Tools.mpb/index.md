## How to get new tools?
A "rule" contained in the MPB will update itself at 02:00 AM if the Management Servers can reach GitHub. If not, the latest MPB can be downloaded and imported manually.

## How to uninstall this MPB?
We believe that this MPB contains useful tools, however in case you want to uninstall, just delete the Management Packs starting with "SCSM Support Tools".
