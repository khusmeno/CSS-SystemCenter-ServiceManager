# Health Status of Management Servers 

After you import the [Support Tools for the SCSM Console](https://aka.ms/scsm.support.tools.mpb), you can view the Health Status of your Management Servers. 
The _SCSM Diagnostic Tool_ will run *automatically* on your Management Servers at 02:30 AM and will determine their Health Status.
