## How to contribute?

- Small changes in the GitHub UI: 
  - Directly edit a file. 
  - A fork will be created (if not already). 
  - Send your changes with a pull request.

- Making changes locally: 
  - Fork the repo (if not already). 
  - Clone your forked repo.
  - Use VS 2019 if you want to make changes in DLLs.
    - Note: You'd need to run Misc/ByPassStrongNameVerificationForMSPublicKeyTokenAssemblies.ps1 once, in order to load locally developed DLLs.
  - Use your favorite XML and PowerShell editors.
  - Run Bundle/_DoALL.ps1 to get everything built and bundled into the Output folder.
  - When done, push your changes and then send a pull request.
  
  Note that, changes must be done other than the Output folder. 

The final SCSM.Support.Tools.mpb file will be generated by the repo owners during a new Release generation.
